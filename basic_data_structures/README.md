# Basic Data Structures

The data structures you should know before starting coding in LeetCode:

* Array
* Linked List
* String
* Stack
* Queue
* Binary Tree
* Binary Search Tree
* Heap
* Hashing
* Graph
* Matrix
* Misc
* Advanced Data Structure

For more information, you need to check related courses and books. Here, most basic data structures are:

* [Array](##Array)
* [Linked List](##Linked-List)
* [String](##String)

## Array

There are many arrays converting standard libraries such as NumPy. The purpose of array converting is to let numerical data can feed into the mathematical or statistical equation. However, for programming practice, you need to know how to: 1)iterate through an array, 2)play tricks using different programming languages, 3)understand bit manipulation

## Linked List

This type of problem includes: 1)delete elements in the linked list, 2)insert elements in the linked list. 3)merge elements from two linked lists 4)rotate elements in a linked list, 5)copy special linked list

## String

String processing is extremely important as a data processing related job. You should consider using a standard library for your daily work. However, for programming practice, you need to solve this kind of problem and familiar with: 1)sorting method/syntax, 2)split and join syntax, 3)encoding and decoding method/syntax, 4)regular expression, 5)hash mapping, 6)Unix utilities(optional)
