# Special Case

The following questions, I prefer to solve by some not commonly used methods. If you interest more about those methods, please find more material about this method.

* [Two Sum](##Two-Sum)
* [String Processing](##String-Processing)
* [Array Converting](##Array-Converting)
* [Prefix Tree](##Prefix-Tree)
* [Topological Sort](##Topological-Sort)
* [Binary Indexed Tree](##Binary-Indexed-Tree)

## Two Sum

Two Sum problem is a variation of the subset sum problem which is Interval-DP. Also, it can  even simply solve using Two Pointers in some situations. I would like to make Two Sum problems as a special case because there is a faster algorithm that will find pairs that sum to S in linear time. The algorithm below makes use of hash tables which have a constant lookup time.

## String Processing

String processing is extremely important as a data processing related job. You should consider using a standard library for your daily word. However, for programming practice, you need to solve this kind of problem and familiar with: 1)sorting method/syntax, 2)split and join syntax, 3)encoding and decoding method/syntax, 4)regular expression, 5)hash mapping, 6)Unix utilities(optional)

## Array Converting

There are many arrays converting standard libraries such as NumPy. The purpose of array converting is to let numerical data can feed into the mathematical or statistical equation. However, for programming practice, you need to know how to: 1)iterate through an array, 2)play tricks using different programming languages, 3)understand bit manipulation

## Prefix Tree

In computer science, a trie, also called digital tree or prefix tree, is a kind of search treeâ€”an ordered tree data structure used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie)

To solve this kind of problem, you need to build a trie. the core content to build trie: 1) insert function, 2) search function. Please prepare the template for this kind of problem.

## Topological Sort

In computer science, a topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge uv from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting)

To solve this kind of problem, you need two steps: 1)initial graph, 2)prune graph

## Binary Indexed Tree

A Fenwick tree or binary indexed tree is a data structure that can efficiently update elements and calculate prefix sums in a table of numbers. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenwick_tree)

For my understanding, the binary indexed tree is another evolution from divided DP. However, when you want to change the preprocessing sum in divided DP, it takes O(n) time, which is not efficient in some cases. Then you may need to choose the binary indexed tree.
